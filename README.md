The code works as follows:
1) There are two files: main.cpp anf prog.cpp
2) prog.cpp will contain the program which will be parsed to pseudo code.
3) main.cpp will be compiled and the output will contain the pseudo-code of prog.cpp file.
4) Also an output.txt file will be generated.
5) Then audio.py will be executed, which will take output,txt as input and will generate an audio file.

*name of audio file is source_code_voice_over.mp3

Note : The code written only generates a pseudo code which has limited functionalities till now. To improve this please contribute to this repo:).
